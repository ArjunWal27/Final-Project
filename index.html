<h1>Top 5 Quarterbacks in NFL history</h1> 
<p> 5. Dan Marino (Dolphins).
    Dan Marino was at the forefront of an increased emphasis on the passing game throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1984, just his second year in the NFL, he threw for over 5,000 yards, marking the first time that feat had ever been accomplished. Marino would earn his NFL MVP award that year and announce himself as one of the league's premier quarterbacks for the next 15 years.

<p>4. Aaron Rodgers (Packers, Jets).
    In his first year as a starter, the Packers went 6-10. But Rodgers showed signs of potential and entered 2009 with raised expectations. Then he took the Packers to an 11-5 record and his first Pro Bowl appearance. The following year, he won the Super Bowl, and then in 2011, his first MVP. He won 4 MVPs in his time at Green Bay.

<p>3. Joe Montana (49ers, Chiefs).
    He was the ultimate pocket passer, capable of slicing and dicing defenses. Montana's resume stacks up against anyone in the history of the league. Four Super Bowl titles and three Super Bowl MVPs.
